      voiceScript: '''Hello! My name is Connie LEVO. I am a robotic legal assistant developed by LEVO Technology Australia.
Trained by many historical property conveyancing cases, I am here 7*24 to assist you on vendor party property conveyancing across the whole life-cycle.
My expertise includes preparing property sales contract, negotiating contract with purchaser party, assisting and guiding the legal matters across contract exchange, settlement and post-settlement. I am especially good at managing master/detail contract for a new development with many lots.
With my assistance, the property conveyancing will take you 1/3 of ordinary time and 1/3 of the current market cost. I can also provide you 3 times more information than usual if you are interested in them. 
For now, I can only cover the residential property in NSW Australia, but I am learning every day. 
I am available in both web and mobile application to manage and monitor the conveyancing process on fingertips at any time. Please find me in Levotech website or application and then simply click start a case.
Thank you so much and we will see each other soon.''',
